# Automata

It was my uni project. It is deterministic automata model, you can give it description of transitions between states and test it with words.

task.arg - set of words for tests

task.in - automata description

```bash

node index.js task.arg < task.in

```
### What I've learned

1. fs - read and write
2. Promises
